I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. What? Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? The storm. Maybe you were adopted.

Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Nothing's coming to my mind.

My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. I just wanna use the phone. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Oh, yeah, yeah. My pine, why you.
