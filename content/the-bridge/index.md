ARTHUR
There it is! The Bridge of Death!

ROBIN
Oh, great.

KNIGHT
Look!

ARTHUR
There's the old man from Scene 24!

BEDEMIR
What is he doing here?

ARTHUR
He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death. He asks each traveller five questions--

GALAHAD
Three questions.

ARTHUR
Three questions. He who answers the five questions--

GALAHAD
Three questions.

ARTHUR
Three questions may cross in safety.

ROBIN
What if you get a question wrong?

ARTHUR
Then you are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.

ROBIN
Oh, I won't go.

ARTHUR
Who's going to answer the questions? Sir Robin!

ROBIN
Yes?

ARTHUR
Brave Sir Robin, you go.

ROBIN
Hey! I've got a great idea. Why doesn't Lancelot go?

LANCELOT
Yes, let me go, my liege. I will take him single-handed. I shall make a feint to the north-east--

ARTHUR
No, no, hang on, hang on, hang on! Just answer the five questions--

GALAHAD
Three questions.

ARTHUR
Three questions as best you can. And we shall watch...and pray.

LANCELOT
I understand, my liege.

ARTHUR
Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot. God be with you.

KEEPER
Stop! Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see.

LANCELOT
Ask me the questions, bridge-keeper. I'm not afraid.

KEEPER
What is your name?

LANCELOT
My name is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

KEEPER
What is your favorite color?

LANCELOT
Blue.

KEEPER
Right. Off you go.

LANCELOT
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

ROBIN
That's easy!

KEEPER
Stop! Who approaches the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see.

ROBIN
Ask me the questions, bridge-keeper. I'm not afraid.
